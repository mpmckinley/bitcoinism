            <p>Bitcoin's radical novelty defies singular definition so we resort to endless metaphors, analogies, and
                abstractions in an attempt to describe it - not as a flaw, but as a feature of its uniqueness and a
                mirror of human sense-making.
                <strong style="color: #F7931A; font-weight: bold;">Bitcoinism</strong> isn’t only about exploring "what
                Bitcoin is," but a formulation of why we can't stop debating
                about what it is – it’s a story of human cognition clashing with radical innovation.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Bitcoin represents a novel cognitive event forcing us individually and collectively to update our
                    conceptual maps of reality.</strong> In this recreation and redrawing of maps, we are discovering
                new beliefs and
                meaning. Some arriving faster than others, we have been and remain in a period of collective sensory
                motor loop formation in the realization of relevance.</p>

                <h3>Economics</h3>
                <p>The raw study of human interaction where praxeology's purposeful actions unfold in voluntary exchanges, turning subjective ends into objective trade-offs that no edict can force but every satoshi inscribes as verifiable value.</p>
                <p>Yet this base layer exposes fiat's distortions, hinting at a remapped system where diminishing marginal utility and opportunity costs evolve into a thermodynamic truth that demands we rethink wealth's very foundation.</p>

            <div class="teaser-column">
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>A humble C++ codebase morphing into a spaghetti of hardware and layers, from CPUs to ASICs, that bootstraps decentralized sovereignty without fanfare, simply delivering speed, scale, and unyielding protocol in the face of nature's brutality.</p>
                <p>But its radical novelty forces us to confront the fork in the road: a tool as mundane as a spoon yet profound enough to propel humanity toward a hopeful existence, where code's quiet evolution promises insights into what innovation truly unlocks.</p>
