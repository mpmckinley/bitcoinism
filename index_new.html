            <p>Bitcoin's radical novelty defies singular definition so we resort to endless metaphors, analogies, and
                abstractions in an attempt to describe it - not as a flaw, but as a feature of its uniqueness and a mirror of human sense-making.
                <strong style="color: #F7931A; font-weight: bold;">Bitcoinism</strong> isn’t only about exploring "what Bitcoin is," but a formulation of why we can't stop debating
                about what it is – it’s a story of human cognition clashing with radical innovation.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin represents a novel cognitive event forcing us individually and collectively to update our
                conceptual maps of reality. In this recreation and redrawing of maps, we are discovering new beliefs and
                meaning. Some arriving faster than others, we have been and remain in a period of collective sensory
                motor loop formation in the realization of relevance.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="quote_mute">Another Bitcoin treatise, yay! If the supply of bitcoin is utterly finite, the supply
                    of Bitcoin writing is quite the inverse. And I think this is a good thing.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In early 2009, a lone tree falling in the forest was heard by all, or at least a few. On the 3rd of
                January, the genesis blocked of Bitcoin was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. A week later, the first
                open-source client was released. The rest as they say, is history. To summarize that history: the
                Bitcoin network and its associated units, bitcoin, have grown in every measure. What began as a
                cypherpunk project with little practical trajectory in which to succeed, has many times over proven a
                resilience and value-creating construct welcoming everyone from terrorists to multi-generational
                endowments into its folds.</p>
            <p>As Bitcoin enters its second decade, passes various market capitalization milestones (and sometimes
                revisits them), …we must reflect. Reflect less on hash rate and market cap, less on the emergent Power
                Law characteristics themselves and its potential adherence to halving cycles. The most confounding thing
                about Bitcoin for many is not only that it is still here but seeing the continued evolution as to what
                it is in contrast to what it was.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Physics was built on a temporal assumption it could never test. From classical mechanics to quantum field
                theory, time was treated as a continuous parameter in the equations, a smooth backdrop against which
                particles move, fields evolve, and measurements occur. But any device we might use to measure time, any
                interaction, any particle, any signal, already unfolds inside that assumed temporal fabric. The clock
                and the thing being timed share the same medium. This makes the continuity of time a self-referential
                axiom rather than an experimentally falsifiable proposition: a system made of time cannot step outside
                time to examine its smallest unit, just as Gödel showed that a formal system cannot fully validate its
                own axioms from within.</p>
